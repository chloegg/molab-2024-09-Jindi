# Week 1

Since I have no experience with app development and have never worked with Swift, I chose to watch the "100 Days of SwiftUI" video series, covering days 1 to 7. It took me a few hours to learn and understand the basic operations of Swift, but it has been very helpful in getting started with Swift programming.

For this week's assignment, I referred to the sample playground for further ideas on how to work with emojis. I chose to create a simple drawing of a house using emojis. A small house will appear on the playground's bottom screen when the ▶️ button is pressed. Since this project is a simple first try at Swift programming, I didn't encounter any difficulties that I couldn’t solve. This has been a good start for me!

# Week 2 

This week, I spent a significant amount of time trying to understand days 8-14 of the "100 Days of SwiftUI" video series. The content and code I learned this week were noticeably more complex and challenging compared to last week. Even after watching the instructional videos, I'm still not entirely confident that I fully grasp all the concepts covered. However, as I continue to use Swift more frequently, I think I will be able to better understand these concepts.

I attempted to create my own ASCII image based on the examples and code provided in the "02-Ascii-Play" section. I copied some food ASCII art from the ASCII art website and made a picnic scene. While writing the code, I encountered some difficulties because the number of lines in each piece of ASCII art was different, which caused some of the bigger ASCII art to lose some lines when displayed. To solve this problem, I tried modifying the code by checking the number of lines in each part and adding blank lines to the parts with fewer lines. This approach worked, and I was able to solve the issue. For better visual appeal, I also experimented with aligning some ASCII art from the bottom, which made the overall image look more balanced and visually interesting.

# Week 3

This week, I continued studying the "100 Days of SwiftUI" video series, focusing on the Starting SwiftUI section. Following along with the small projects in the videos has been very helpful for my understanding and practice of SwiftUI. If I have enough time, I plan to watch more content later in the "100 Days" series.

For this week's assignment, I tried to create a simple SwiftUI page called "Get Today's Lucky Foods and Colors." This interface can randomly generate a background color and a fruit, and when you click the "GET!" button, it will randomly generate a new color and fruit.
